Done for version 2.10.0 (released ??/??/??):
  Fixed
      1- subst(1+x^3+O(x^6),x,x+O(x^4)) -> SEGV [#1865]
BA    2- lfunartin was using too much stack
BA    3- fflog in char 3 or 5 was slower than intended
      4- RgX_blocks only worked for t_INT or t_POL coeffs
      5- spurious bnrdlisclist entries (with negative number of real
         places...) when modulus not a conductor
BA    6- modular algorithms could fail for very large input
BA    7- [mingw] writebin did not work

  Changed
      1- rewrite bnfnarrow
      2- the bid struct from idealstar has been changed, the new format is
         not compatible with pari-2.9
      3- bnrdisclist output is now an ordinary vector (not a vector of vectors)
      4- made nfsign() / nfsign_arch() reliable [ use algebraic method
         besides floating point approximation to real embeddings ]
      5- support ??refcard-ell  (or mf/nf/lfun)
      6- [libpari internals] bnrinit(,,1) [with generators] is no longer
         necessary for bnrsurjection()
      7- bnrinit(,,1) is no longer necessary for bnrL1, bnrconductor,
         bnrrootnumber, bnrstark, rnfkummer, galoissubcyclo

  Added
      1- [libari] ZM_isidentity
      2- [libpari] rename buchnarrow -> bnfnarrow
      3- [libpari] ZX_radical
BA    4- parallel fflog in characteristic at most 5
BA    5- [gmp] support for mpn_divexact_1

Changed

Removed
      1- file 'MACHINES' (no longer maintained)
      2- useless argument nf in ZC_nfval, ZC_nfvalrem, pr_equal, ZC_prdvd
