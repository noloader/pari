C-Name: lfunsymsqspec
Prototype: Gb
Help: lfunsymsqspec(L): Ldata corresponding either to a normalized
  eigenform or to the output of lfunsymsq, returns [val, om2], where val
  is the vector of special values of the symmetric square of the modular form
  on the right of the critical strip, and om2 is a period, not canonically
  normalized. For the moment, only for modular forms of even weight.
Doc: \kbd{L} corresponding either to a normalized eigenform or to the
  output of \kbd{lfunsymsq}, returns \kbd{[val, om2]}, where \kbd{val} is
  the vector of special values of the symmetric square of the modular form
  on the right of the critical strip, and \kbd{om2} is a period, not
  canonically normalized (so that if for instance the form has rational
  coefficients, \kbd{om2} is a rational multiple both of the Petersson square
  of the form and of the product $\omega^+\omega^-$ of the special values
  output by \kbd{lfunmfspec}).
  For the moment, only for modular forms of even weight.
