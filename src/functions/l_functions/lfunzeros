Function: lfunzeros
Section: l_functions
C-Name: lfunzeros
Prototype: GGD8,L,b
Help: lfunzeros(L,lim,{divz=8}): lim being
 either an upper limit or a real interval, computes an ordered list of
 zeros of L(s) on the critical line up to the given upper limit or in the
 given interval. Use a naive algorithm which may miss some zeros.
 To use a finer search mesh, set divz to some integral value
 larger than the default (= 8).
Doc: \kbd{lim} being either an upper limit or a real interval, computes an
 ordered list of zeros of $L(s)$ on the critical line up to the given
 upper limit or in the given interval. Use a naive algorithm which may miss
 some zeros: it assumes that two consecutive zeros at height $T \geq 1$
 differ at least by $2\pi/\omega$, where
 $$\omega := \kbd{divz} \cdot \big(d\log(T/2\pi) +d+ 2\log(N/(\pi/2)^d)\big).$$
 To use a finer search mesh, set divz to some integral value
 larger than the default (= 8).
 \bprog
 ? lfunzeros(1, 30) \\ zeros of Rieman zeta up to height 30
 %1 = [14.134[...], 21.022[...], 25.010[...]]
 ? #lfunzeros(1, [100,110])  \\ count zeros with 100 <= Im(s) <= 110
 %2 = 4
 @eprog\noindent The algorithm also assumes that all zeros are simple except
 possibly on the real axis at $s = k/2$ and that there are no poles in the
 search interval.

 Should you pass an \kbd{Linit} argument to the function, beware that the
 algorithm needs at least
 \bprog
    L = lfuninit(Ldata, T+1, 4)
 @eprog\noindent where $T$ is the upper bound of the interval defined by
 \kbd{lim}. This allows to detect zeros near $T$ as well as a zero of 4th
 order at most at $s = k/2$. Make sure that your \kbd{Linit} domain contains
 this one. (You may increase the 4 to some higher order, of course.)
